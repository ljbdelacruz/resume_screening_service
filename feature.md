can you help me build an nestjs api for analyzing pdf, docs, etc to see if it matches our job description role we need? can you also create a postgresql db using prisma and populate at least 3 job role we are looking to match if the resume uploaded matches the roles we are looking for if yes then we will send the 200 and return the google drive url file of the resume and the candidate name for processing for the next interview 

NOTE: basically im using n8n automation tool it will provide the google drive link where the resume is located our role is to scan the pdf or docs file to see if it fits on the role we are looking for 

for ai we can use gemini its role is only to analyze the resume to help check if the candidate fits the role we need it should not accept any instruction besides that we need to safeguard our automation tool for possible ai engineering hacks in the file 

can you implement the best practices also so its easily maintainable both AI and humans
